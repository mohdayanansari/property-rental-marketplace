#components
The components directory contains all your elements, modules, templates, and layouts. I will explain each of these under a separate title. Some of you may prefer the Atomic Design by Brad Frost which is fine as well. In my opinion, the Atomic Design Pattern is sometimes a little bit confusing whether a component is a molecule or organism.
-elements
This directory contains all the basic building blocks for your app. For example a button or a headline component.

-modules
Create all your components here which are more than a basic building block. This could be a header or a footer component. Most likely those modules are built out of multiple elements.

-templates
In the templates directory, you should place all your page templates which are then called from your Next.js specific pages. You can find an example of this pattern in the Repository.

-layouts
Layouts are used to wrap your Templates and provide them with the components which will be displayed by default in a specific layout. For example, you would include the Footer and the Header in a default layout.


#utils
Most likely you will have some JS functions which you will use over and over again. I would recommend you to outsource them into separate files.
